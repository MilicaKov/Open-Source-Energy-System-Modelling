# Open-Source-Energy-System-Modelling
This project is part of the coursework for the "Open Source Energy System Modelling" class. 
The core functionality of this project revolves around a set of Python functions designed to compute key properties of trigonometric shapes.
The functions themselves are rather simple but are useful for future more complex projects and applications in energy system modelling. Fore example in the scope of land use planning and component sizing in energy systems (rectangle), estimating cross-sectional areas of cables and pipes (circle), understanding the distribution of forces and in the structural analysis of energy infrastructure(triangle).

Below is a brief overview of the main functions included in this project, along with their purpose:
1. calculate_circle_properties(radius): Calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius. 
2. calculate_rectangle_properties(length, width): Computes the area and perimeter of a rectangle. 
3. calculate_triangle_properties(side1, side2, side3): Determines the area and perimeter of a triangle based on the lengths of its sides.
